I don't know what else goes here git made the file without telling me \__(-_-)__/
Oh danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
All through the glen
And down the mountainside
The summer's gone
And all the roses falling
It's you, it's you
Must go, and I must bide
But come ye back,
When summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed, and white with snow
'Tis (or For) I'll be here
In sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy
Oh Danny boy
I love you so
But when ye come
And all the flowers are dying
If I am dead,
As dead I may well be
You'll come and find
The place where I am lying
And kneel and say
An "Ave" there for me
And I shall hear
Though soft you tread above me
And all my grave
Will warmer, sweeter be
For you will bend
And tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come for me
