# Red_Queen

	Hello biology based computer game enthusiast! Welcome to Red Queen, the all-in-one, fight-for-survival, cutthroat
java game of the century. Red Queen, the evolutionary theory from which we get the name, states that organisms evolve 
as part of a survival-driven arms race, the primary example being Gazelles and Cheetahs both becoming progressively
faster as they evolve to outrun, or run down. You will begin each turn by drawing 3 cards. Click on one of the 3 decks
in the middle of the screen to draw. Your cards will appear at the bottom of your screen in your hand. If your hand grows
too large, you can click on the arrows to see your whole hand. It is advised that on your first turn you draw at least one
organism card. The only way to win the game after all is to have the last organism standing. Click a card in your hand to
pick it up and click again on the left hand part of the screen to play the card. Organism cards will become grid organisms
and all other cards can be placed in a square on the organism. Click a card to utilize its resources (ATP/Toxin) and the card
 will flip over. ATP is used to play special cards, whose cost can be found in the little green batteries. Toxin is auto-committed
 and will attack the other organism if you flip the card. Cards will be killed by toxin at random to maximize the realistic 
 nature of pathogens in the biological world. The game is won when you toxin an organism successfully enough to knock out all of
 its resistance, noted by the grey shields. Click the "Done" button when your turn ends and the computer will take its turn. Have Fun!
