I don't know what else goes here git made the file without telling me \__(-_-)__/
Oh danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
All through the glen
And down the mountainside
The summer's gone
And all the roses falling
It's you, it's you
Must go, and I must bide
But come ye back,
When summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed, and white with snow
'Tis (or For) I'll be here
In sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy
Oh Danny boy
I love you so
